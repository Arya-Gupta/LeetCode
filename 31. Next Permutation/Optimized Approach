// Explanation -
Traverse the array linearly from the end - find first index i such that a[i] > a[i + 1] --> index1
Traverse the array linearly from the end upto arr[i + 1] - find next greater element of arr[i] --> index2
Swap the elements at index1 and index2
Reverse everything to the right of index1 to obtain the next permutation
