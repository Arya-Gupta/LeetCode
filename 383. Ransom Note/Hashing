// Time Complexity - Time taken to iterate through the the strings is O(N).
// Space Complexity - Space taken to store characters is O(N).
// Explanation - We store characters in magazine in an unordered_map. 
As we iterate through the characters in randsomNote, we keep reducing their frequency in the unordered_map. If the frequency is already 0, ransomeNote cannot be formed.

public:
    bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {

            if(!mp[ch]--) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
